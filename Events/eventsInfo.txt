Event-driven Programming
Used Heavily in Node.js

->In Browser, events like this: 
user click on button, user hovers over the link
->In Server-side
we listen for specific events and register functions that will execute in response to tthose events,
So once, our event takes place callback function fires

//FREECODECAMP
const customEmitter = new EventEmitter(); //we create an instance from the events module

//we have 2  methods in events
// on - listen for an event
// emit - emit an event

//1st parameter - event
//2nd parameter - callback which is consist of your actions
customEmitter.on('response', ()=>{ //add event listener
console.log(`data received`);
})
customEmitter.emit('response') //call it/ emit it

AWARE!
1.
WHEN YOU HAVE more than one respponse event and then you emit it once, 
all of them will be emitted

2. the order is matter  on -> emit , not!!! emit -> on 
We should first listen for event and then we emit it

3.
we can pass the arguments when we're omitting the event 
if i write customEmitter.emit('response', 'john', 26),
then before it in 'on' method, we take them as arguments from the callback :
customEmiiter.on('response', (name, id)=>[
  //your code...
])
